* Put run-time dependencies in ~propagatedBuildInputs~.
* DONE Have ~buildOctaveLibrary~ add those to its ~propagatedBuildInputs~. (DONE)
* TODO Add the run-time dependency to ~PATH~ when building
  1) In ~wrapper.nix~ (or a ~wrap.sh~), when reading each package to add's ~$out~ directory for package installation:
     1. Look for ~$path/nix-support/propagated-build-inputs~
     2. If it exists, ~cat~ it through a ~for~ loop.
     3. Recurse onto that path, and see if we need to add anything from that package to ~PATH~.
     4. See ~python/wrap.sh:_addToPythonPath()~ for greater clarity.
     5. ~addToSearchPath~ is defined in ~stdenv/generic/setup.sh~ and is available for us to use.
* TODO To make things easier, find a way to get a ~wrap.sh~ to be present in the build system.
